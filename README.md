### Project Title
Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project：
I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.

I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to
 create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
chicago.csv
new_your_city.csv
Washington.csv

### Credits
Thanks to Udacity courses which help me build the solutions.
